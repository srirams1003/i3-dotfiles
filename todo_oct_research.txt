reinforcement learning vs supervised fine tuning because we cannot use deep learning

and how much compute do we need? hprc or colab pro?

opensource or closed source LLM? for both, can we host ourself on hprc? or do we need to use API?

when to do reinforcement learning vs when to do supervised fine tuning?

three policies for reducing ambiguity in user queries:
1. rewrite query
2. long answer
3. clarification question
